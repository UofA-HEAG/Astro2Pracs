# Research Project: Unravelling the Origin of Astrophysical Neutrinos

Topics: Neutrinos, IceCube, gamma-ray astronomy, particle physics, maths, python programming

## Motivation
In 2017 - for the first and only time - it has been possible to trace neutrinos back to an astronomical object. Despite this important but unique discovery, the origin of astrophysical neutrinos still remains a mystery.

In a typical production scenario of astrophysical neutrinos, both neutrinos and gamma rays are produced. This connection can be used to predict the number of neutrinos based on gamma-ray observations. 

This project will investigate the connection between gamma-ray and neutrino observations based on simple assumptions and production scenarios.

## Tasks

* *Introduction*. Read up on the following keywords: Astroparticle physics, neutrino astronomy, IceCube neutrino observatory, gamma-ray astronomy, multi-messenger astronomy. 
Think about the following questions: 
    - What is astroparticle physics? Which particles are studied in this field? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these particles?
    - What is neutrino astronomy? How can neutrinos be measured? How can high-energy neutrinos be measured? Which experiments measure high-energy neutrinos? What are atmospheric neutrinos and what is their spectrum? What are astrophyiscal neutrinos and what do we know about them?
    - What is gamma-ray astronomy?
    - How are gamma rays and neutrinos connected? 
    - What are possible sources of neutrinos and gamma rays?

* *Production scenarios*. Describe the basics of hadronic and leptonic scenarios to produce gamma rays and/or neutrinos. Assuming a hadronic scenario, which ratio between gamma rays and neutrinos is expected?

* *Number of gamma rays*. Calculate the number of gamma rays in a given energy range for a given spectrum. Consider the following sources / resources:
    - Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 (brightest Active Galactic Nuclei)
    - 1ES 1959
    - 3HWC: A catalog of sources detected in VHE (HAWC) can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08582.pdf. HAWC is a water cherenkov experiment, observing a much larger fraction of the sky than imaging Cherenkov telescopes, but at a worse sensitivity.

* *Atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos*. Plot the atmospheric, the astrophysical and the total neutrinos spectrum in one plot. Below this plot, plot the ratio between atmospheric and astrophyscial neutrinos. Which energy regime would you consider to study astrophysical neutrinos?

* *IceCube HESE events*. What are the so-called HESE events? Assuming this analysis, which energy regime would you consider to study astrophysical neutrinos?

* *Estimation of neutrino number*. Assuming a hadronic scenario, how many neutrinos would you expect from gamma-ray source studied before (in a given energy range)? Which energy range should you consider? How many atmospheric neutrinos would you expect in this energy range?

* *Estimation of IceCube neutrinos*. How many of the calculated neutrinos will IceCube detect? 

* *Comparison with measurements*. How many astrophysical neutrinos did IceCube measure so far? Compare this number to the number you estimated from a specific source / all sources.
