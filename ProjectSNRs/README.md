# Research Project: Gamma-Ray Observations and Modeling of Supernova Remnants

Topics: HESS, python programming, supernova remnants, diffusion, modeling, cosmic rays, gamma rays

## Motivation

Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are astrophysical objects, emitting radiation over the complete electromagnetic spectrum. ...

Gamma-ray astronomy is a rather young research field and covers the study of the upper part of the electromagnetic spectrum (MeV to TeV energy regime). Depending on the targeted energy of the gamma rays, the measurement with satellite- or ground-based instruments is advantageous. High-energy (HE) gamma rays are typically measured with satellites, while very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays are measured from the ground. Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) measure the Cherenkov light that is emitted by the extensive air shower, initiated by the gamma ray interacting with the Earth's atmosphere. The particles of this shower can also be detected using the water Cherenkov method.

## Tasks

* **Introduction**. Read up on the following keywords: Astroparticle physics, gamma-ray astronomy, imaging air cherenkov telescopes, Cherenkov Telescope Array, Fermi-LAT, Active Galactic Nuclei, extragalactic background light. 
Think about the following questions: 
    - What is astroparticle physics? Which particles are studied in this field? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these particles?
    - What is gamma-ray astronomy? How can gamma rays be measured? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques? Which measurement is used in which energy regime? 
    - What are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)? Which subtypes of AGN exist and how are they distinguished?
    - What is the extragalactic background light? How does this light influence gamma rays and the gamma-ray spectrum measured at Earth?
