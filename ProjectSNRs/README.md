# Research Project: Gamma-Ray Observations and Modeling of Supernova Remnants

Topics: HESS, python programming, supernova remnants, diffusion, modeling, cosmic rays, gamma rays, interstellar medium.

## Motivation
Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are astrophysical objects, emitting radiation over the complete electromagnetic spectrum.
They are the remains of stars that exploded in a supernova, and their shock wave is expanding into the interstellar medium. 
SNRs are thought to be responsible for the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays.
They can produce energetic shock fronts with cosmic-ray particles of ultra-high energy, but it still remains a mystery if they are also able to accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. 
Cosmic-ray protons can interact with the interstellar medium and produce gamma rays via pion decay. 
Therefore, gamma-ray observations can be used to study these intriguing objects.

Gamma-ray astronomy is a rather young research field and covers the study of the upper part of the electromagnetic spectrum (MeV to TeV energy regime). Depending on the targeted energy of the gamma rays, the measurement with satellite- or ground-based instruments is advantageous. High-energy (HE) gamma rays are typically measured with satellites, while very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays are measured from the ground. Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) measure the Cherenkov light that is emitted by the extensive air shower, initiated by the gamma ray interacting with the Earth's atmosphere. The particles of this shower can also be detected using the water Cherenkov method.

This research project aims to model the cosmic rays and gamma rays from supernova remnants to reveal the origin of the unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1804-216.

## Tasks

* **Introduction**. Read up on the following keywords: Astroparticle physics, gamma-ray astronomy, supernova remnants, diffusive shock accleration, Fermi acceleration I and II. 
Think about the following questions: 
    - What is astroparticle physics? Which particles are studied in this field? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these particles?
    - What is gamma-ray astronomy? How can gamma rays be measured? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques? Which measurement is used in which energy regime? 
    - What are Supernova Remnants (SNRs)?
