# Research Project: Observations with Adelaide's All-Sky Camera: Studies of the Atmosphere & Stars, Novae and other Transients

Topics: python programming, all-sky camera, analysis, atmosphere, stars, novae

## Motivation

Observations by any optical telescopes are affected by clouds and characteristics of the atmosphere. As these observations take place during nighttime, the identification of clouds in the sky is challenging and requires advanced devices and analysis techniques. One approach is to use all-sky camera images and a sophisticated software developed in Adelaide to determine the visibilities of stars and compare them to catalogue values. As clouds reduce the visibility of a star, this provides transmission (=cloudiness) measurements of the entire sky, together with cloud maps. Other usages of all-sky cameras include observations of serendipitous transients (short-lived events, such as novae), and brightnesses of stars over time (e.g. cepheids). Such all-sky camera is installed on the roof of the Oliphant building and has been taking data for more than a year.  

## Schedule
* Week 3: Overleaf. Introduction atmospheric monitoring, variable astronomical objects.


## Tasks

* **Introduction**. Read up on the following keywords: Atmospheric monitoring and devices, all-sky cameras and how to analyse their night-sky images, hipparcos star catalogue. Variable stars and astrophysical objects, novae. 
Think about the following questions: 
    - List different atmospheric conditions. How do atmospheric conditions influence astronomical images? What different devices / methods measure atmospheric conditions? How can we use an all-sky camera to measure atmospheric conditions?
    - What type of variable astronomical objects are there? How can you get information about variability from star catalogues? What are novae? List the brightest novae of the past year that were visible from Australia (including their magnitude).
